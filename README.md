The "Unsupervised Learning" Folders contains the files required to train and run the models, as well as the data files that are used, both for our dataset and for ALFA.

The "Rule-checking" Folders contains the Aprioiri file required to generate the rules, as well as the data files that are used, both for our dataset and for ALFA.

The "Overall Checks" Folders contains the overall evaluation of the approach, combining both methods, as well as the data files used, both for our dataset and for ALFA.

The ipynb notebooks in each file can be run as-is to generate the scores for each of the approaches, for each of the datasets.
